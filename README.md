Microsoft is looking to venture into the world of original video content creation by
establishing a new movie studio. However, lacking experience in the film industry, they

Your goal is to identify the types of films that are performing well and translate these
findings into actionable insights for the head of Microsoft’s new movie studio. By
understanding the preferences of audiences and the types of films that resonate with
them, Microsoft can make informed decisions on the types of movies to create to
maximize their chances of success in this new venture.
